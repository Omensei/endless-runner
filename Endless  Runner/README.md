A simple one-button vertical platformer game built in Unity. The player jumps between platforms, and the camera follows as they ascend endlessly.

## 🚀 Features
- Jump mechanics with grounded detection
- Procedural platform spawning
- Camera follow system
- Simple UI for score/height
- Game over and restart logic

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Camera tracking logic
- Refactoring scripts for modular design
- Clean Git workflows

## ▶️ Controls
